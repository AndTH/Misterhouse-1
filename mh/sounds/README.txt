To ease mh upgrades, do not add files here.  Create your own sound dir, then 
update   mh.ini sound_dir to point to it.   This dir will is pointed to 
with the mh.ini sound_dir_common parm.

Some sources of sound files:
  http://www.findsounds.com
  http://www.wavcentral.com
  http://www.wavsearch.com
  http://www.moviewavs.com

Nature sounds (e.g. birds/frogs) make for nice event sounds.
