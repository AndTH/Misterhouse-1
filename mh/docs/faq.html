<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.1: what oses can it run on">1.1: What OSes can it run on?</A></H2>
<P>It has been tested on Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, and 2K.  On Unix, it has been run on
Linux, AIX, and Sun.</P>
<P>In theory, any OS that runs perl should be able to run mh.  In practice, some platforms
will likely have strange Serial Interfaces (e.g. Mac?), so the Serial IO related
function would take some work.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.2: how can i make it run faster and use less memory">1.2: How can I make it run faster and use less memory?</A></H2>
<P>On my Celron 400 Mhz computer running Windows 98, using 60 code files with 6000 lines of code,
mh takes 10% the cpu, running at 9 passes per second and using about 30 MB of memory.</P>
<P>If you are happy with the Web interface and don't need the Tk interface, turn it off
by editing the Tk mh.ini parm or run:</P>
<PRE>
   mh -tk 0</PRE>
<P>If you want the tk window, but don't use the Command/Items/Group pull down menus, try:</P>
<PRE>
   mh -tk_comands 0 -tk_items 0 -tk_groups 0</PRE>
<P>You can turn off the tk 'eye' that bounces back and forth by deleting the tk_eye.pl code file.</P>
<P>You can speed up / slow down mh, using more/less cpu, by mh.ini sleep_time parm.</P>
<P>Here are some memory stats:</P>
<PRE>
  Linux
    10 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0 mh_control.pl (run just one code file)
    12 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0               (run all the test code)
    17 Meg   &lt;- mh                     (run all the test code with tk gui on)
</PRE>
<PRE>

  Windows
    18 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0 mh_control.pl (run just one code file)
    20 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0               (run all the test code)
    27 Meg   &lt;- mh                     (run all the test code with tk gui on)</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.3: how can i easily upgrade to the latest version of mh">1.3: How can I easily upgrade to the latest version of mh?</A></H2>
<P>Point your mh.ini code_dir, data_dir, and html_dir parms to somplace other than your mh path.  
Then you should be able to rename your old mh directory and unzip the new one in its place without loosing
anything.  Also keep your mh.private.ini somewhere else (see next question).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.4: how does mh.ini work">1.4: How does mh.ini work?</A></H2>
<P>All the entries in mh.ini are read on mh Startup and on a Reload.  They are stored 
in the %config_parms array.  So, for example, if you added:</P>
<PRE>
  myparm1=a b c</PRE>
<P>Then, mh would set $config_parms{myparm1} = 'a b c';</P>
<P>These parms also defined what are legal startup values, so if you want to try
a different value, instead of editing your mh.ini, you can run:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -myparm1 'd e f'</PRE>
<P>Rather then edit the default mh.ini file, the best approach is to copy just
the parms you want to change to your own .ini file (e.g. mh.private.ini), then 
set the environmental variable mh_parms to point where you keep that file
(see the header of mh/bin/mh.ini for more detail).</P>
<P>While the %config_parms array IS refreshed on a mh Reload, some parms are only used
on mh startup (e.g. http_port), so will only be reloaded when you re-start mh.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.5: can i run run mh in a 'fast debug mode'">1.5: Can I run run mh in a 'fast debug mode'?</A></H2>
<P>Funny you should ask :)  Check out the time_start, time_stop, and time_increment parms
in the mh.ini file.  Here are some examples:</P>
<PRE>
   mh -time_start 0 -time_stop 24 -tk 0 -voice_text 0
   mh -time_start &quot;6 AM&quot; -time_stop &quot;11 PM&quot;  -time_increment 1
   mh -time_start &quot;5/14 7:10&quot; -time_stop &quot;5/15 10 PM&quot; -time_increment 300</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.6: how are the x10 and serial items implemented, indpendent of the platform">1.6: How are the X10 and Serial Items implemented, indpendent of the platform?</A></H2>
<P>This answer is authored by Bill Birthisel, author of the SerialPort and CommPort modules.</P>
<P>The user works with an X10_Item which reflects physical hardware and
the state of that hardware. The user ``loop'' code deals with the state and
conditions which alter it. This code is independent of OS and specific to
mh.</P>
<P>X10_Items talk to Serial_Items which implement a software protocol
required by the model and type of the actual hardware. The Serial_Items
can use protocol translator modules such as CM11.pm, HomeBase.pm,
and CM17.pm. But the output is platform-independent serial commands
to the next layer. The protocol translator modules are publicly available
outside mh and may be used by code other than Serial_Items. These modules will
eventually be on CPAN. The code is still independent of OS.
Other Serial_Item types, including ``generic'' read/write ports, also exist.</P>
<P>Win32::SerialPort.pm and Device::SerialPort.pm are CPAN modules which
actually implement the serial command interface. Device::SerialPort is a
clone of its Win32 cousin. These modules handle high-level OS issues
including device names, configuration files, and validation of port 
settings.</P>
<P>Each also calls a CPAN module to handle low-level interfacing to the OS
and the serial driver: Win32API::CommPort.pm or POSIX.pm (you guessed
correctly ;-)</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.7: mh seems way too complicated. how can i run something simple">1.7: mh seems way too complicated.  How can I run something simple?</A></H2>
<P>Copy mh\code\test\test_x10.pl into your own code dir (e.g. c:\mh_code).  Then run:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -code_dir c:\mh_code</PRE>
<P>You can then use <A HREF="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</A> for control.  This will also run all the
code in mh/code/common.  To run JUST a specific code member(s), specify 
it on the command line.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
  mh test_x10.pl</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.8: is there a way i can have direct x10 control with a simple perl script">1.8: Is there a way I can have direct X10 control with a simple perl script?</A></H2>
<P>If all you want to do is control X10 devices with a cron job or from your own cgi scripts,
running mh is probably overkill.  You can send X10 commands using either the ActiveHome
interface (CM11) or the cheaper Firecracker interface (CM17) using the modules
and documentation found in mh/lib/site/ControlX10 or download them from CPAN.
Examples can be found in mh/lib/site/test_cm11.pl and test_cm17.pl.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.9: can i send mh commands from other programs">1.9: Can I send mh commands from other programs?</A></H2>
<P>You can send mh commands (Voice_Cmd text strings) from other programs in many ways:</P>
<P>- Write commands to the file specified in the mh.ini xcmd_file parm.  By default this
is mh/house_cmd.txt. See mh/bin/house and mh/bin/house.bat for examples.</P>
<P>- Use mh/bin/mhsend to send commands via sockets (can be over the internet).  If you have
run mh/bin/set_password, the mhsend -password parm is required.   To enable this, include
the code mh/test/code/mhsend_server.pl in your code directory.</P>
<P>For example, from a computer on your network, you can run this:</P>
<PRE>
 .../mh/bin/mhsend -host ip.A -run &quot;All Lights On&quot;</PRE>
<P>Where ip.A is computer A's ip address (or name if you have a HOST file setup
to alias a name to an ip address).  mhsend is a stand alone perl script,
so you do not need mh running there (although it will not hurt).</P>
<P>You can also control mh remotely via email (see faq question 'Can do I send mh comands via email?'),
telnet sessions (if running mh/code/test/telent.pl), and via the built in web server.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.11: how can i debug a problem">1.11: How can I debug a problem?</A></H2>
<P>Lots of debug errata can be controled with the mh -debug switch.  Most of this code is probably 
meaningful only if you dig into the source code, so most people probably will not use
it unless you are generating debug to send to the author.  To create a log file with debug in it,
run:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -log debug.log -debug xyz</PRE>
<P>Where xyz can be any of the following:</P>
<PRE>
  X10    
  serial 
  socket
  startup
  homebase
  misc
  http
  port_name of socket port</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.12: how can i debug time event problem">1.12: How can I debug time event problem?</A></H2>
<P>One way is to create a code member that contains just the event you are trying to debug, then run mh on 
just that one member.  For example, create a member called \temp\test_time.pl with this code:</P>
<PRE>
  print &quot;min=$Minute\n&quot; if $New_Minute;
  print &quot;hour=$Hour\n&quot;  if $New_Hour;
  print &quot;debug1 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;11:59 PM&quot;;
  print &quot;debug2 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;23:59&quot;;
  print &quot;debug3 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;12:00 AM&quot;;
  print &quot;debug4 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;00:00&quot;;</PRE>
<P>Then run mh using these parameters:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -code_dir \temp -tk 0 -time_start '12/15 11:58 pm' -time_start '12/16 12:01 am'</PRE>
<P>Note, you can run this test mh quickly without stoping your normal mh.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.13: what are the advantages/disadvantages to running the compiled versions of mh">1.13: What are the advantages/disadvantages to running the compiled versions of mh?</A></H2>
<P>Advantages:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
You don't need the latest version of perl installed
<P></P>
<LI>
You don't have to install additional perl modules
<P></P></UL>
<P>Disadvantages:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
For some reason, starting mh with the compiled versions is slower.  On my windows box, it is 10 seconds -vs- 20 seconds.
<P></P>
<LI>
You can apply quick patches to mh, -vs- downloading a larger, less frequently updated mh.exe file.
<P></P></UL>
<P>The memory and cpu used, once mh is started, is the same.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.14: how does mh read and use the user code in code_dir">1.14: How does mh read and use the user code in code_dir</A></H2>
<P>Each time mh is started or a Reload is done, mh will re-read all the .pl code members 
in the code_dir directory (this is a mh.ini parm)
and the file code_dir/mh_temp.user_code is created.
All of the objects and global variables (see FAQ question 2.4), are put at top
of this file, and everything else is put in seperate subroutines, one for each file read.
A &amp;loop_code subroutine is also created (at the very bottom of mh_temp.user_code), that 
calls each member subroutine.</P>
<P>After creating this file, mh runs the perl eval function on its contents.  This re-creates all the objects,
global variables, and code_dir member subroutines.  Then mh goes back into its normal loop where
it queries various input data (e.g. serial, tcp/ip, voice, time), updates objects and variables, 
evals the &amp;loop_code code (it does an eval, rather then execute it directly, so we can trap errors and 
not kill mh), sleeps for a bit, then repeats.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.15 how can i control mh from a nonmh web server like apache">1.15 How can I control mh from a non-mh web server like Apache?</A></H2>
<P>You can think of the built in mh web server as 2 parts:</P>
<PRE>
 - The part that auto-generates web pages that reflect your items and commands.</PRE>
<PRE>
 - The part that responds to commands you give it via URLs.</PRE>
<P>You don't really have to use the first part. 
Some mh users custom generate their own mh pages, to be served by the mh server or
by a different server.  This allows for full control of 
what is on the web control page and how it looks.</P>
<P>There is more (probably not so easy to read) documentation on how to do this  
under 'Customizing the Web Interface' in mh/docs/mh.html</P>
<P>You can also use something like mh/code/test/mhsend_server.pl
and then read/write to sockets directly from non-mh web server cgi scripts.
Or have the web server script simply call mh/bin/mhsend to run mh commands.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.16 is there a frontend tool for defining/editing mh items/events">1.16 Is there a front-end tool for defining/editing mh items/events?</A></H2>
<P>Not yet, but you can now define items/events in a table-like format.
This should allow us to enable a gui or web based front end tools for editing.</P>
<P>Currently we have defined just one format defined, creativly named A,
but other formats (e.g. XML) should be easy to implement.</P>
<P>To use, create one or more *.mht (mh table) files in your code directory, specifying the table format with Format=A
at the top of the table.  Then mh will process (on starup and reload) each record with mh/lib/read_table_A.pl, to create
*.mhp (mh processed) files, which are then processed with all your other mh *.pl code files.</P>
<P>Examples are in mh/code/bruce/*.mht and mh/code/test/*.mht. 
If you want to create another table format, all you need to do is create a mh/lib/read_table_xyz.pl member, then set Format=xyz.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.17: how can i use family radios with misterhouse">1.17: How can I use Family Radios with MisterHouse?</A></H2>
There is seperate FAQ on the FRS topic in
<a href="faq_frs.html">mh/docs/faq_frs.html</a><P>
<H2><A NAME="1.18: is there a way to tell if mh is shutdown correctly or not">1.18: Is there a way to tell if MH is shutdown correctly or not?</A></H2>
<P>On windows, mh/bin/mh.bat checks errorlevel and on linux, mh/bin/mhl finds the return code via $?.
Both of these shells will restart mh unless they detect a normal exit (rc=1).</P>
<P>This code in mh/code/common/mh_control.pl will detect an abnormal restart:</P>
<PRE>
 if ($Startup and $Save{mh_exit} ne 'normal') {
    display &quot;MisterHouse auto restarted: $Save{mh_exit}&quot;, 0;
 }</PRE>
<P>If you want to detect a power outage and you have a CM11, 
code in mh/code/common/mh_control.pl will set $Power_Supply, so you can do something like this:</P>
<PRE>
 if (state_now $Power_Supply eq 'Restored') {
    speak 'You should have bought a ups';
 }</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="1.19: how can i use an internet appliance with misterhouse">1.19: How can I use an Internet Appliance with MisterHouse?</A></H2>

<H2><A NAME="1.20: how can i point misterhouse to a custom web interface">1.20: How can I point MisterHouse to a custom web interface?</A></H2>
<P>From David Norwood on 10/2001</P>
<P>Here's a way to configure Misterhouse so you can have your own custom web
interface AND still have access to web pages that are introduced with new
releases (like the Audrey pages).</P>
<P>Let's assume your misterhouse distribution is in /misterhouse/mh and your
custom html files are in /misterhouse/web/custom.   Set these private.ini
parameters:</P>
<PRE>
 html_dir=$Pgm_Root/web
 html_file=/custom/index.html
 html_alias_custom=/custom       /misterhouse/web/custom</PRE>
<P>Now your custom web pages will come up by default, but you will still have
access to the latest and greatest ``mh4'' and ``ia*'' interfaces.  Your pages
will not be over-written by new releases.  If you need another directory
for, say, your audrey interface, just add another html_alias_whatever
parameter.</P>

<H1><A NAME="2: misterhouse coding questions">2: MisterHouse coding questions</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="2.1: how do i debug syntax errors in my code">2.1: How do I debug syntax errors in my code?</A></H2>
<P>If there are syntax errors in your code, most of them will be caught on startup or reload.
The error, and (hopefully) relevant code member and/or line number, will show up in 
your console, and if running Tk, in a Tk window on reload.</P>
<P>When you go to write new code, first start mh with old code that works, then edit or copy in 
your new code and do a mh Reload.  Fixing errors with code Reloads is much 
quicker than trying to fix them on mh startup.  You can add/delete the .pl suffix
on code members between reloads to enable/disable them.</P>
<P>Some errors (e.g. too few/many {} around code) will point to a misleading line number.
In these cases, if you can not find the file with the error, 
you can try a new option: mh -error_by_file 1 .
This will try loading one file at a time untill the error is found, but
it runs pretty slow and may not work with members that have # noloop directives.</P>
<P>Some errors will only show up after mh triggers events.  The first time this happens, a console/tk message
will be displayed, and a message spoken.  Since these errors might happen on sequential passes of mh, subsequent errors 
are only listed in the console window.  If more than 10 occur, another window is displayed,
and the code member there error was in is disabled.</P>
<P>All of these on-the-fly errors are logged in the file mh_temp.error_log in your code directory.
This is useful if you are not running tk and the error has scrolled out of your console window.</P>
<P>You can enable the perl diagnostics module (same as perl -w) to get additional warnings on potential 
coding errors.  Either use mh -diagnostics 1 or set diagnostics=1 in your mh.ini.  This takes
about 1 meg more of memory and causes mh to run about 10% slower, but the messages it displays
often point to valid problems.
To simplify coding, the 'uninitialized value' warnings disabled in the user code processing.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="2.2: how should i code events that should occur only at infrequently, or only at startup">2.2: How should I code events that should occur only at infrequently, or 
only at Startup?</A></H2>
<P>You can use the $Startup or $Reload variables for events that should only
occur when mh is Started, or when code is Reloaded.  Note that $Reload
is also true when $Startup is true.</P>
<P>To run events infrequently, you can use the modulus operator (%),
$New_Second/Hour/Day/Month/Year variables,
or the Time_Now/Time_Cron functions to control events.</P>
<P>The $New_xxx variables are 1 (true) for each pass that the xxx variable gets incremented, 
and 0 for all other passes.  For example, $New_Hour is true for one pass
when $Hour changes from one hour to another.</P>
<P>Here are some examples:</P>
<PRE>
  print_log &quot;Only at startup&quot; if $Startup;</PRE>
<PRE>
  print_log &quot;Every 5 minutes&quot; if $New_Minute and !($Minute % 5);</PRE>
<PRE>
  print_log &quot;At 10:05 pm&quot; if time_now '10:05 PM';</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="2.3: how should i structure my perl code">2.3: How should I structure my Perl code?</A></H2>
<P>Pretty much anyway you want!  You may want to put object definitions all in one 
member (e.g. mh/code/Bruce/items.pl) so you can easily change device codes,
or you may want to define the objects in the file members you use them in.</P>
<P>If the same object is defined in multiple members, it will still work ok, although
some object types (e.g. Voice_Item) will warn about duplicate names.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="2.4: can i create global variables that can be shared between code members">2.4: Can I create global variables that can be shared between code members?</A></H2>
<P>Yep.  All objects definitions (e.g. $light = new <CODE>X10_Item('C5'))</CODE> are always shared.  They are pulled out of the member loop by mh.</P>
<P>All other variable declarations must be made using with 'my' or 'use vars':</P>
<PRE>
   my ($my_var1, $my_var2);
   use vars '$my_var1', '$my_var2';
   use vars qw($my_var1 $my_var2);</PRE>
<P>The last example uses the qw function (Quote Words) to save you from the ' and , punctuation.</P>
<P>If you code a 'my' or 'use var' record that starts in column 1,
mh will pull these records out of the member loop code (as it did with object definitions),
so that the variable can now be shared with other code members.</P>
<P>If the 'my' or 'use var' record does not start in column 1, the variable declaration
is left in with the rest of the member code and is local to that member.</P>
<P>If you want to use the variable with any mh/web/*.pl script when creating
mh web pages, you must use 'use vars', as 'my' variables can not be shared with the server.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="2.5: how can i move code out of the loop code">2.5: How can I move code out of the loop code?</A></H2>
<P>Sometimes you may need to have mh run code out of the loop code.  For example, if you
want to create a Voice_Cmd object that has states that are read from a file.  Since
objects are moved out of the loop code by mh, we need to also move any other code used
to define that object.</P>
<P>You can tell mh to do this using '# noloop=start/stop' comments.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
   # noloop=start
   my $mp3names;
   while ( my $mp3name = &lt;d:/songs/*.mp3&gt; ) {
      $mp3name =~ s#^.*/##;  # remove path
      $mp3name =~ s#\..*$##; # remove extension
      $mp3names .= &quot;,&quot; if $mp3names;
      $mp3names .= $mp3name;
   }
  # noloop=stop</PRE>
<PRE>
  $v_play_music = new Voice_Cmd(&quot;Play [$mp3names]&quot;);

<H2><A NAME="3.1: when i run viavoice and festival at the same time i get can't open output file '/dev/dsp'">3.1: When I run Viavoice and festival at the same time I get ``Can't open output file '/dev/dsp'''</A></H2>
<P>Answer complements of Brent L Johnson.</P>
<P>The problem is, festival or another sound program, is locking your dsp device.
The sound drivers that come stock in the Linux kernel do not allow more than one program to access the /dev/dsp at one time. 
If you are using RedHat, you can use ESD to multiplex the soundcard usage.
The problem is, not all sound programs are esd aware. Festival and Viavoice  do not directly support esd.
ESD does have a workaround that _sometimes_ works with non-esd aware programs.
Try starting your sound programs, festival and viavoice under esddsp.
For example: ``esddsp festival --server &amp;''. 
I had some success with this route but it doesn't always work because of sampling rates and such.</P>
<P>The best fix would be to replace OSS with ALSA. <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org.">http://www.alsa-project.org.</A>
The ALSA drivers directly support multiplexing the dsp devices. 
The only problem is they currently support fewer cards than the OSS drivers that come with the Linux kernel.
Check out the web page and see if your card is supported. If it is, the best avenue would be replacing OSS with ALSA.</P>
<P>From Dave Lounsberry and Denis Cheong on 10/2001:</P>
<P>Problem: The speech stutters and then stops half way through, and I end up with 'hung' vv_tts.pl
processes that do not complete.</P>
<P>Solution: You need to use ViaVoice_Outloud 5.0 with ``any'' ALSA driver.
ViaVoice Outloud 5.1 does not work with ALSA, but it seems that downgrading to 5.0 fixes it.
You can get the it here:

<P>This might work ... it has not been tested.</P>
<P>You can globally increase the volume of all waveforms generated by
festival by adding the following to your siteinit.scm.  Put that in
the festival/lib directory, (where all the other .scm files are)
probably /usr/lib/festival/lib if you used the standard rpms.  Add the
following</P>
<PRE>
    (set! default_after_synth_hooks

            (lambda (utt)
              (utt.wave.rescale utt 1.0 t))))</PRE>
<P>This will maximises the volume within a wavefrom, this wont necessary
make all voices the same loudness (though it will be close).</P>
<P>Alternatively</P>

    (set! default_after_synth_hooks
          (list
            (lambda (utt)
               (utt.wave.rescale utt 4.0))))</PRE>
<P>will mutiply the waveform by 4 but this has the problem that it may overflow.</P>
<P>If you want X% of the maximum without overflow use the first example
and lower the 1.0 until you get an acceptable volume</P>

<P>From Dave Lounsberry on 1/1/2002</P>
<P>First make sure you have the device nodes for the extra serial ports.
You should have /dev/ttyS[16..23]. If not:
  # cd /dev
  # ./MAKEDEV ttyS16  (repeat for each device)</P>
<P>Next you need to run setserial to setup the board. The kernel defaults
to only two serial ports. Put the following in a file called
/etc/rc.serial and make sure it runs each boot.</P>

<P>Note that I am using irq 4 for my byterunner. Be careful that you don't

<P>Here is a followup from Nigel Titley:</P>
<P>I have found that the linux serial card driver doesn't like the serial
card to be on a shared interrupt (I assume your Byterunner is a PCI card and
not ISA). I had exactly this problem and worked around it by using the BIOS
to move interrupts around until the serial card set itself up on an unshared
IRQ. Everything then worked. This does seem to be a Linux issue, and I haven't
taken the plunge yet and tried to find out where in the serial port driver
the bug exists (I guess I am hoping that someone else will do it).</P>

<P>If you want to contribute new code or fixes/updates, you have 3 options:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Bet a sourceforge.net account and check it in to the CVS repository there.
<P></P>
<LI>
You send Bruce a pointer to a web page for the new code (e.g. Brad does that with the viavoice tts code).
<P></P>
<LI>
You Bruce and/or the mailing list a copy via email.  Either full source or a diff patch file is fine.
<P></P></OL>
<P>By far most people choose option 3, which is probably easiest for all, but any of the above is fine.</P>
<P>If you choose the cvs option, you can get started with instructions at:</P>

<P>Here is the command to check out the mh repository.  Do this someplace other than your main mh directory.
It does not include all the mh code (some of which came from CPAN and is maintained elsewhere),
so you will not be able to run out of this directory.
Also change username to your sourceforge id:</P>
<PRE>
  cd \sourceforge
  cvs -d:ext:username@cvs.misterhouse.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/misterhouse co mh</PRE>
<P>When you have code you want to check in, you would do it with somethink like this:</P>
<PRE>
  cp \mh\lib\http_server.pl \sourceforge\mh\lib
  cd \sourceforge\mh\lib
  cvs commit http_server.pl</PRE>
<P>You don't have to do the CVS thing if you want to make mh changes.  Most changes are simply emailed to Bruce.
Either way works fine.</P>

<H2><A NAME="6.6 what is x10">6.6 What is X10?</A></H2>
<P>The people at <A HREF="http://www.x10.com">http://www.x10.com</A> sell affordable devices that communicate with each other over 
normal household power lines.  Manuals for many of there devices are listed
at <A HREF="http://www.x10.com/support/support_manuals.htm">http://www.x10.com/support/support_manuals.htm</A></P>
<P>The most common modules are the Lamp module and the Appliance module.  Both sell for around $10-$15.
The lamp module has can turn up to 300 watt lamps on, off, and various levels of bright. 
The appliance module is an on/off relay.</P>
<P>The 2 most popular X10 PC interfaces are  
the $50 ActiveHome/CM11 and the $6 Firecracker/CM17.</P>
<P>The CM17 is a transmit only interface.  In addition to being almost free, another advantage is
it is wireless. It is a small, 1 inch box that just dangles off of your serial port and transmits
to a receiver that plugs into the wall.  The other advantage to the CM17 is gives
instant ON/OFF control to the relay built into the wireless receiver.  All other X10 devices
have about a 1/2 second delay to send and receive the protocol over the power lines.</P>
<P>The CM11 is a 2 way interface, so you can program mh events to react to X10 motion sensor 
and button pushes from various X10 controlers (e.g. keychain and palmpads).
Some of the newer, more expensive modules, like the $35 LM14A lamp module,
allow you to query their status, so you can determine it status even if it were manually turned on or off.</P>
<P>If decide you splurge for the CM11 activehome kit, you might as well also get the Firecracker kit.
For the extra $6, you also get a few extra modules and mh can support both the CM11 and the CM17 
on the same port.</P>
<P>There is lots of great X10 info at <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ido_bartana">http://www.geocities.com/ido_bartana</A> , 
including information on using and buying X10 hardward outside of the US.</P>
<P>Here is some more info, copied from a misterhouse-users post by Kevin Olalde.</P>
<P>The firecracker hardware, CM17 which plugs into the PC, can only send radio
frequency (RF) commands to devices.  With the kit you will also get a
transceiver, TM751, that receives commands from the CM17 and relays
commands for the house code it's set to via your power lines.  You also get
a lamp module, LM465,  which can be control with via the transceiver.  With
the PalmPad or the CM17 you send RF commands  to the TM751, those commands
are then relayed to the lamp module (or other power line receiver modules,
like light switches).  All of this is one way communications, the LM465
lamp module and the TM751 transceiver are not capable of reporting status.
The TM751 doubles as an appliance module hard coded to unit 1.  You can
only control it though RF commands, it does not respond to power pline
commands.</P>
<P>The next step I took was to order the Active Home kit.  With it you get
(among other stuff), another transceiver, RR501, and another computer
interface, CM11A.  The RR501 works like the TM751, in that it receives RF
commands, and relays then on to the power line.  A difference is that the
RR501 can report it's status.  The computer interface, CM11A, can send
power line commands (you use computer software to tell the interface what
commands to send), 'sees' all commands being sent over the power line (and
reports those commands to computer software), and can ask modules for their
status.  The RR501 also doubles as an appliance module, it can be set to
unit code 1 or 9, and can be controlled with both RF and power line
commands.</P>
<P>The majority of the devices, lamp modules, appliance modules, wall
switches, ..... are one way devices, they can only receive.  I have no
historical perspective, but it looks as though that was the way the
original X10 spec went, one way only.</P>
<P>There are devices that can report their current status to something like
the CM11A, but I haven't used any of then (except for the RR501), since
that are much more expense.</P>

<P>Here is a post from Clay Jackson</P>
<P>Right now, I've got 3 sensors (DS1822, in the three-lead package, inside an
epoxy filled soda straw) at the end of 150' of Radio Shack ``flat'' cable,
talking to a DS9097U (the U is CRITICAL) with no problems.  On the bench, I
had another 2 sensors on the end of a 50' cable (for a total of 5 sensors).
When I strung the 50' cable, I must have crimped a lead, because it now
meters ``closed'' and when it was plugged into the ``net'', I got no readings.</P>
<P>I also have an HA5 from Point-Six; that I'm gonna play with soon. The code
Bruce did is for the 9097U, so that's why I started there (and, it's
cheaper).  The 9097U has all the ``passive'' pull-up stuff the data sheets
talk about (courtesy of a DS2048 inside the DB9); so I'm hoping it will do
the trick.  Anyway, I'll keep the list posted as things progress.</P>
<P>Bottom line - all I needed was Bruce's code, a 9097U from Dallas, the
sensors and some Radio Shack ``phone'' cable.</P>
<P>One more thing to watch - as best I can tell, Dallas has not standardized
their thermal devices with respect to their outputs.  For example, the
DS1820 and DS1920  both return a 9 bit value that's basically an integer.
However, the DS1822 returns a VARIABLE length value (12 bits by default),
with a binary point between the 3rd and 4th digits.  According to someone
else on the list, the ThermoCRON iButton is different yet again.</P>
