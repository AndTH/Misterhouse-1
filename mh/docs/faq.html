<H1><A NAME="1: misterhouse operational questions">1: MisterHouse operational questions</A></H1>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.1: what oses can it run on">1.1: What OSes can it run on?</A></H2>
<P>It has been tested on Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, and 2K.  On Unix, it has been run on
Linux, AIX, and Sun.</P>
<P>In theory, any OS that runs perl should be able to run mh.  In practice, some platforms
will likely have strange Serial Interfaces (e.g. Mac?), so the Serial IO related
function would take some work.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.2: how can i make it run faster and use less memory">1.2: How can I make it run faster and use less memory?</A></H2>
<P>On my Celron 400 Mhz computer running Windows 98, using 60 code files with 6000 lines of code,
mh takes 10% the cpu, running at 9 passes per second and using about 30 MB of memory.</P>
<P>If you are happy with the Web interface and don't need the Tk interface, turn it off
by editing the Tk mh.ini parm or run:</P>
<PRE>
   mh -tk 0</PRE>
<P>If you want the tk window, but don't use the Command/Items/Group pull down menus, try:</P>
<PRE>
   mh -tk_comands 0 -tk_items 0 -tk_groups 0</PRE>
<P>You can turn off the tk 'eye' that bounces back and forth by deleting the tk_eye.pl code file.</P>
<P>You can speed up / slow down mh, using more/less cpu, by mh.ini sleep_time parm.</P>
<P>Here are some memory stats:</P>
<PRE>
  Linux
    10 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0 mh_control.pl (run just one code file)
    12 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0               (run all the default code)
    17 Meg   &lt;- mh                     (run all the default code with tk gui on)
</PRE>
<PRE>

  Windows
    18 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0 mh_control.pl (run just one code file)
    20 Meg   &lt;- mh -tk 0               (run all the default code)
    27 Meg   &lt;- mh                     (run all the default code with tk gui on)</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.3: how can i easily upgrade to the latest version of mh">1.3: How can I easily upgrade to the latest version of mh?</A></H2>
<P>Point your mh.ini code_dir, data_dir, and html_dir parms to somplace other than your mh path.  
Then you should be able to rename your old mh directory and unzip the new one in its place without loosing
anything.  Also keep your mh.private.ini somewhere else (see next question).</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.4: how does mh.ini work">1.4: How does mh.ini work?</A></H2>
<P>All the entries in mh.ini are read on mh Startup and on a Reload.  They are stored 
in the %config_parms array.  So, for example, if you added:</P>
<PRE>
  myparm1=a b c</PRE>
<P>Then, mh would set $config_parms{myparm1} = 'a b c';</P>
<P>These parms also defined what are legal startup values, so if you want to try
a different value, instead of editing your mh.ini, you can run:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -myparm1 'd e f'</PRE>
<P>Rather then edit the default mh.ini file, the best approach is to copy just
the parms you want to change to your own .ini file (e.g. mh.private.ini), then 
set the environmental variable mh_parms to point where you keep that file
(see the header of mh/bin/mh.ini for more detail).</P>
<P>While the %config_parms array IS refreshed on a mh Reload, some parms are only used
on mh startup (e.g. http_port), so will only be reloaded when you re-start mh.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.5: can i run run mh in a 'fast debug mode'">1.5: Can I run run mh in a 'fast debug mode'?</A></H2>
<P>Funny you should ask :)  Check out the time_start, time_stop, and time_increment parms
in the mh.ini file.  Here are some examples:</P>
<PRE>
   mh -time_start 0 -time_stop 24 -tk 0 -voice_text 0
   mh -time_start &quot;6 AM&quot; -time_stop &quot;11 PM&quot;  -time_increment 1
   mh -time_start &quot;5/14 7:10&quot; -time_stop &quot;5/15 10 PM&quot; -time_increment 300</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.6: how are the x10 and serial items implemented, indpendent of the platform">1.6: How are the X10 and Serial Items implemented, indpendent of the platform?</A></H2>
<P>This answer is authored by Bill Birthisel, author of the SerialPort and CommPort modules.</P>
<P>The user works with an X10_Item which reflects physical hardware and
the state of that hardware. The user ``loop'' code deals with the state and
conditions which alter it. This code is independent of OS and specific to
mh.</P>
<P>X10_Items talk to Serial_Items which implement a software protocol
required by the model and type of the actual hardware. The Serial_Items
can use protocol translator modules such as CM11.pm, HomeBase.pm,
and CM17.pm. But the output is platform-independent serial commands
to the next layer. The protocol translator modules are publicly available
outside mh and may be used by code other than Serial_Items. These modules will
eventually be on CPAN. The code is still independent of OS.
Other Serial_Item types, including ``generic'' read/write ports, also exist.</P>
<P>Win32::SerialPort.pm and Device::SerialPort.pm are CPAN modules which
actually implement the serial command interface. Device::SerialPort is a
clone of its Win32 cousin. These modules handle high-level OS issues
including device names, configuration files, and validation of port 
settings.</P>
<P>Each also calls a CPAN module to handle low-level interfacing to the OS
and the serial driver: Win32API::CommPort.pm or POSIX.pm (you guessed
correctly ;-)</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.7: mh seems way too complicated. how can i run something simple">1.7: mh seems way too complicated.  How can I run something simple?</A></H2>
<P>Copy mh\code\test\test_x10.pl into your own code dir (e.g. c:\mh_code).  Then run:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -code_dir c:\mh_code</PRE>
<P>You can then use <A HREF="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</A> for control.  This will also run all the
code in mh/code/common.  To run JUST a specific code member(s), specify 
it on the command line.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
  mh test_x10.pl</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.8: is there a way i can have direct x10 control with a simple perl script">1.8: Is there a way I can have direct X10 control with a simple perl script?</A></H2>
<P>If all you want to do is control X10 devices with a cron job or from your own cgi scripts,
running mh is probably overkill.  You can send X10 commands using either the ActiveHome
interface (CM11) or the cheaper Firecracker interface (CM17) using the modules
and documentation found in mh/lib/site/ControlX10 or download them from CPAN.
Examples can be found in mh/lib/site/test_cm11.pl and test_cm17.pl.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.9: can i send mh commands from other programs">1.9: Can I send mh commands from other programs?</A></H2>
<P>You can send mh commands (Voice_Cmd text strings) from other programs in many ways:</P>
<P>- Write commands to the file specified in the mh.ini xcmd_file parm.  By default this
is mh/house_cmd.txt. See mh/bin/house and mh/bin/house.bat for examples.</P>
<P>- Use mh/bin/mhsend to send commands via sockets (can be over the internet).  If you have
run mh/bin/set_password, the mhsend -password parm is required.   Some examples:</P>
<PRE>
  mh/bin/mhsend -host ip.A -run &quot;All Lights On&quot;
  mhsend -p password -run &quot;turn living room light on&quot;</PRE>
<P>Where ip.A is computer A's ip address (or name if you have a HOST file setup
to alias a name to an ip address).  mhsend is a stand alone perl script,
so you do not need mh running there (although it will not hurt).
The code that allows this is in mh/code/common/mhsend_server.pl.
An example of mh code to act as a client to different mh box is in mh/code/examples/test_server2.pl</P>
<P>- You can also control mh remotely via email (see faq question 'Can do I send mh comands via email?'),
telnet sessions (if running mh/code/common/telent.pl), and via the built in web server.  An example url
for the web server is:</P>
<PRE>
  <A HREF="http://192.168.1.10:8080/RUN">http://192.168.1.10:8080/RUN</A>;last_response?turn_living_room_light_on</PRE>
<P>- If you are runing IM client (if running code file internet_im.pl) 
like AOL AIM, MSN, or Jabber, you can any voice command to 
MisterHouse if you give Misterhouse its own account to logon with.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.11: how can i debug a problem">1.11: How can I debug a problem?</A></H2>
<P>Lots of debug errata can be controled with the mh -debug switch.  Most of this code is probably 
meaningful only if you dig into the source code, so most people probably will not use
it unless you are generating debug to send to the author.  To create a log file with debug in it,
run:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -log debug.log -debug xyz</PRE>
<P>Where xyz can be any of the following:</P>
<PRE>
  X10    
  serial 
  socket
  startup
  homebase
  misc
  http
  port_name of socket port</PRE>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.12: how can i debug time event problem">1.12: How can I debug time event problem?</A></H2>
<P>One way is to create a code member that contains just the event you are trying to debug, then run mh on 
just that one member.  For example, create a member called \temp\test_time.pl with this code:</P>
<PRE>
  print &quot;min=$Minute\n&quot; if $New_Minute;
  print &quot;hour=$Hour\n&quot;  if $New_Hour;
  print &quot;debug1 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;11:59 PM&quot;;
  print &quot;debug2 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;23:59&quot;;
  print &quot;debug3 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;12:00 AM&quot;;
  print &quot;debug4 it is now $Time_Now\n&quot; if time_now &quot;00:00&quot;;</PRE>
<P>Then run mh using these parameters:</P>
<PRE>
  mh -code_dir \temp -tk 0 -time_start '12/15 11:58 pm' -time_start '12/16 12:01 am'</PRE>
<P>Note, you can run this test mh quickly without stoping your normal mh.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.13: what are the advantages/disadvantages to running the compiled versions of mh">1.13: What are the advantages/disadvantages to running the compiled versions of mh?</A></H2>
<P>Advantages:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
You don't need the latest version of perl installed
<P></P>
<LI>
You don't have to install additional perl modules
<P></P></UL>
<P>Disadvantages:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
For some reason, starting mh with the compiled versions is slower.  On my windows box, it is 10 seconds -vs- 20 seconds.
<P></P>
<LI>
You can apply quick patches to mh, -vs- downloading a larger, less frequently updated mh.exe file.
<P></P></UL>
<P>The memory and cpu used, once mh is started, is the same.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.14: how does mh read and use the user code in code_dir">1.14: How does mh read and use the user code in code_dir</A></H2>
<P>Each time mh is started or a Reload is done, mh will re-read all the .pl code members 
in the code_dir directory (this is a mh.ini parm)
and the file code_dir/mh_temp.user_code is created.
All of the objects and global variables (see FAQ question 2.4), are put at top
of this file, and everything else is put in seperate subroutines, one for each file read.
A &amp;loop_code subroutine is also created (at the very bottom of mh_temp.user_code), that 
calls each member subroutine.</P>
<P>After creating this file, mh runs the perl eval function on its contents.  This re-creates all the objects,
global variables, and code_dir member subroutines.  Then mh goes back into its normal loop where
it queries various input data (e.g. serial, tcp/ip, voice, time), updates objects and variables, 
evals the &amp;loop_code code (it does an eval, rather then execute it directly, so we can trap errors and 
not kill mh), sleeps for a bit, then repeats.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.15 how can i control mh from a nonmh web server like apache">1.15 How can I control mh from a non-mh web server like Apache?</A></H2>
<P>You can think of the built in mh web server as 2 parts:</P>
<PRE>
 - The part that auto-generates web pages that reflect your items and commands.</PRE>
<PRE>
 - The part that responds to commands you give it via URLs.</PRE>
<P>You don't really have to use the first part. 
Some mh users custom generate their own mh pages, to be served by the mh server or
by a different server.  This allows for full control of 
what is on the web control page and how it looks.</P>
<P>There is more (probably not so easy to read) documentation on how to do this  
under 'Customizing the Web Interface' in mh/docs/mh.html</P>
<P>You can also use something like mh/code/common/mhsend_server.pl
and then read/write to sockets directly from non-mh web server cgi scripts.
Or have the web server script simply call mh/bin/mhsend to run mh commands.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="1.16 is there a frontend tool for defining/editing mh items/events">1.16 Is there a front-end tool for defining/editing mh items/events?</A></H2>
<P>Not yet, but you can now define items/events in a table-like format.
This should allow us to enable a gui or web based front end tools for editing.</P>
<P>Currently we have defined just one format defined, creativly named A,
but other formats (e.g. XML) should be easy to implement.</P>
<P>To use, create one or more *.mht (mh table) files in your code directory, specifying the table format with Format=A
at the top of the table.  Then mh will process (on starup and reload) each record with mh/lib/read_table_A.pl, to create
*.mhp (mh processed) files, which are then processed with all your other mh *.pl code files.</P>
<P>Examples are in mh/code/bruce/*.mht and mh/code/test/*.mht. 
If you want to create another table format, all you need to do is create a mh/lib/read_table_xyz.pl member, then set Format=xyz.</P>

There is seperate FAQ on the FRS topic in
<a href="faq_frs.html">mh/docs/faq_frs.html</a><P>
<H2><A NAME="1.18: is there a way to tell if mh is shutdown correctly or not">1.18: Is there a way to tell if MH is shutdown correctly or not?</A></H2>
<P>On windows, mh/bin/mh.bat checks errorlevel and on linux, mh/bin/mhl finds the return code via $?.
Both of these shells will restart mh unless they detect a normal exit (rc=1).</P>
<P>This code in mh/code/common/mh_control.pl will detect an abnormal restart:</P>
<PRE>
 if ($Startup and $Save{mh_exit} ne 'normal') {
    display &quot;MisterHouse auto restarted: $Save{mh_exit}&quot;, 0;
 }</PRE>
<P>If you want to detect a power outage and you have a CM11, 
code in mh/code/common/mh_control.pl will set $Power_Supply, so you can do something like this:</P>
<PRE>
 if (state_now $Power_Supply eq 'Restored') {
    speak 'You should have bought a ups';
 }</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="1.20: how can i point misterhouse to a custom web interface">1.20: How can I point MisterHouse to a custom web interface?</A></H2>
<P>From David Norwood on 10/2001</P>
<P>Here's a way to configure Misterhouse so you can have your own custom web
interface AND still have access to web pages that are introduced with new
releases (like the Audrey pages).</P>
<P>Let's assume your misterhouse distribution is in /misterhouse/mh and your
custom html files are in /misterhouse/web/custom.   Set these private.ini
parameters:</P>
<PRE>
 html_dir=$Pgm_Root/web
 html_file=/custom/index.html
 html_alias_custom=/custom       /misterhouse/web/custom</PRE>
<P>Now your custom web pages will come up by default, but you will still have
access to the latest and greatest ``mh4'' and ``ia*'' interfaces.  Your pages
will not be over-written by new releases.  If you need another directory
for, say, your audrey interface, just add another html_alias_whatever
parameter.</P>
<P>You can now also override just specific pages from an existing web interface.
For example, create your own web/ia5 and web/ia5/security

<H2><A NAME="1.21: where is perl program code located">1.21: Where is perl program code located?</A></H2>
<P>From Harald Koch on 2/2002.</P>
<P>There are (at least) three different locations for scripts:</P>
<P>/mh/bin - standalone programs (such as get_weather, get_tv_grid); they
    are called from the main MH process via ``run'' or a Process_Item;
    they do not get any environment or variables from the main MH
    program, and typically return results to MH by writing output files
    which MH later reads.</P>
<PRE>
    MH typically looks for external programs here, and also programs
    here typically assume they're being run from this directory; they
    try to find files in ../lib, for example.</PRE>
<P>$config_parms{code_dir} - scripts in this directory are (after some
    parsing) loaded into the middle of the MH event loop, and the
    commands in them run constantly. They run within the MH environment,
    and can use all the variables available there.</P>
<P>$config_parms{html_dir} - scripts in this directory are run by the HTTP
    server, and are expected to return blobs of HTML. They too run
    inside the MH process, and can access all variables, subroutines,
    etc.</P>
<P>Each script directory has a different purpose, and programs in one are
generally not terribly useful in another. My weather processing, for
example, has scripts in all three places; mh/bin/get_weather_ca is the
standalone that fetches/parses HTML, code/weather_ec.pl is the script
that creates and processes voice commands and timer events, and then I
have scripts in /web/weather/ that format the HTML for display.</P>

<H2><A NAME="2.1: how do i debug syntax errors in my code">2.1: How do I debug syntax errors in my code?</A></H2>
<P>If there are syntax errors in your code, most of them will be caught on startup or reload.
The error, and (hopefully) relevant code member and/or line number, will show up in 
your console, and if running Tk, in a Tk window on reload.</P>
<P>When you go to write new code, first start mh with old code that works, then edit or copy in 
your new code and do a mh Reload.  Fixing errors with code Reloads is much 
quicker than trying to fix them on mh startup.  You can add/delete the .pl suffix
on code members between reloads to enable/disable them.</P>
<P>Some errors (e.g. too few/many {} around code) will point to a misleading line number.
In these cases, if you can not find the file with the error, 
you can try a new option: mh -error_by_file 1 .
This will try loading one file at a time untill the error is found, but
it runs pretty slow and may not work with members that have # noloop directives.</P>
<P>Some errors will only show up after mh triggers events.  The first time this happens, a console/tk message
will be displayed, and a message spoken.  Since these errors might happen on sequential passes of mh, subsequent errors 
are only listed in the console window.  If more than 10 occur, another window is displayed,
and the code member there error was in is disabled.</P>
<P>All of these on-the-fly errors are logged in the file mh_temp.error_log in your code directory.
This is useful if you are not running tk and the error has scrolled out of your console window.</P>
<P>You can enable the perl diagnostics module (same as perl -w) to get additional warnings on potential 
coding errors.  Either use mh -diagnostics 1 or set diagnostics=1 in your mh.ini.  This takes
about 1 meg more of memory and causes mh to run about 10% slower, but the messages it displays
often point to valid problems.
To simplify coding, the 'uninitialized value' warnings disabled in the user code processing.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="2.2: how should i code events that should occur only at infrequently, or only at startup">2.2: How should I code events that should occur only at infrequently, or 
only at Startup?</A></H2>
<P>You can use the $Startup or $Reload variables for events that should only
occur when mh is Started, or when code is Reloaded.  Note that $Reload
is also true when $Startup is true.</P>
<P>To run events infrequently, you can use the modulus operator (%),
$New_Second/Hour/Day/Month/Year variables,
or the Time_Now/Time_Cron functions to control events.</P>
<P>The $New_xxx variables are 1 (true) for each pass that the xxx variable gets incremented, 
and 0 for all other passes.  For example, $New_Hour is true for one pass
when $Hour changes from one hour to another.</P>
<P>Here are some examples:</P>
<PRE>
  print_log &quot;Only at startup&quot; if $Startup;</PRE>
<PRE>
  print_log &quot;Every 5 minutes&quot; if $New_Minute and !($Minute % 5);</PRE>

<H2><A NAME="2.3: how should i structure my perl code">2.3: How should I structure my Perl code?</A></H2>
<P>Pretty much anyway you want!  You may want to put object definitions all in one 
member (e.g. mh/code/Bruce/items.pl) so you can easily change device codes,
or you may want to define the objects in the file members you use them in.</P>
<P>If the same object is defined in multiple members, it will still work ok, although
some object types (e.g. Voice_Item) will warn about duplicate names.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="2.4: can i create global variables that can be shared between code members">2.4: Can I create global variables that can be shared between code members?</A></H2>
<P>Yep.  All objects definitions (e.g. $light = new <CODE>X10_Item('C5'))</CODE> are always shared.  They are pulled out of the member loop by mh.</P>
<P>All other variable declarations must be made using with 'my' or 'use vars':</P>
<PRE>
   my ($my_var1, $my_var2);
   use vars '$my_var1', '$my_var2';
   use vars qw($my_var1 $my_var2);</PRE>
<P>The last example uses the qw function (Quote Words) to save you from the ' and , punctuation.</P>
<P>If you code a 'my' or 'use var' record that starts in column 1,
mh will pull these records out of the member loop code (as it did with object definitions),
so that the variable can now be shared with other code members.</P>
<P>If the 'my' or 'use var' record does not start in column 1, the variable declaration
is left in with the rest of the member code and is local to that member.</P>
<P>If you want to use the variable with any mh/web/*.pl script when creating
mh web pages, you must use 'use vars', as 'my' variables can not be shared with the server.</P>
<P>
<H2><A NAME="2.5: how can i move code out of the loop code">2.5: How can I move code out of the loop code?</A></H2>
<P>Sometimes you may need to have mh run code out of the loop code.  For example, if you
want to create a Voice_Cmd object that has states that are read from a file.  Since
objects are moved out of the loop code by mh, we need to also move any other code used
to define that object.</P>
<P>You can tell mh to do this using '# noloop=start/stop' comments.  For example:</P>
<PRE>
   # noloop=start
   my $mp3names;
   while ( my $mp3name = &lt;d:/songs/*.mp3&gt; ) {
      $mp3name =~ s#^.*/##;  # remove path
      $mp3name =~ s#\..*$##; # remove extension
      $mp3names .= &quot;,&quot; if $mp3names;
      $mp3names .= $mp3name;
   }
  # noloop=stop</PRE>

<P>Answer complements of Brent L Johnson.</P>
<P>The problem is, festival or another sound program, is locking your dsp device.
The sound drivers that come stock in the Linux kernel do not allow more than one program to access the /dev/dsp at one time. 
If you are using RedHat, you can use ESD to multiplex the soundcard usage.
The problem is, not all sound programs are esd aware. Festival and Viavoice  do not directly support esd.
ESD does have a workaround that _sometimes_ works with non-esd aware programs.
Try starting your sound programs, festival and viavoice under esddsp.
For example: ``esddsp festival --server &amp;''. 
I had some success with this route but it doesn't always work because of sampling rates and such.</P>
<P>The best fix would be to replace OSS with ALSA. <A HREF="http://www.alsa-project.org.">http://www.alsa-project.org.</A>
The ALSA drivers directly support multiplexing the dsp devices. 
The only problem is they currently support fewer cards than the OSS drivers that come with the Linux kernel.
Check out the web page and see if your card is supported. If it is, the best avenue would be replacing OSS with ALSA.</P>
<P>From Dave Lounsberry and Denis Cheong on 10/2001:</P>
<P>Problem: The speech stutters and then stops half way through, and I end up with 'hung' vv_tts.pl
processes that do not complete.</P>
<P>Solution: You need to use ViaVoice_Outloud 5.0 with ``any'' ALSA driver.
ViaVoice Outloud 5.1 does not work with ALSA, but it seems that downgrading to 5.0 fixes it.
You can get the it here:

<P>Here is a followup from Nigel Titley:</P>
<P>I have found that the linux serial card driver doesn't like the serial
card to be on a shared interrupt (I assume your Byterunner is a PCI card and
not ISA). I had exactly this problem and worked around it by using the BIOS
to move interrupts around until the serial card set itself up on an unshared
IRQ. Everything then worked. This does seem to be a Linux issue, and I haven't
taken the plunge yet and tried to find out where in the serial port driver
the bug exists (I guess I am hoping that someone else will do it).</P>
<P>Here is some useful serial info from Bob Hughes:</P>
<P>Here is another way to look at the current serial port settings</P>

<P>Here is a good tutorial note from Mike Bruno  on 4/2002</P>
<P>OK, here's the quick and dirty on startup scripts.</P>
<P>(You also may wish to check out
<A HREF="http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/doc/82/en/ref.html/sysv.html">http://www.linux-mandrake.com/en/doc/82/en/ref.html/sysv.html</A>
which is where I pulled some of the stuff you'll
find below)</P>
<P>Just for reference, there's two methodologies that
are used for bringing up Unix systems: BSD and SysV.
Mandrake uses SysV.  BSD is initially simpler, but
the SysV method is more flexible.  The names of the
methods and their merits should not really concern
you at the moment, its just background in case
someone jumps out of the woods and asks you.</P>
<P>I should also mention that there may be some sort
of fancy graphical interface into all this.  But
its much more satisfying to get your hands dirty
and roll your own solution.</P>
<P>The boot scripts are located in /etc/rc.d.  If you
look in there, you'll find several subdirectories
named init.d and rc0.d -&gt; rc6.d.  The rc?.d directories
correspond directly to the various runlevels that
Unix supports.  Runlevel is a set of predefined modes
that define what the system does.
Mandrake has the runlevels defined as</P>
<PRE>
 0: complete machine stop;</PRE>
<PRE>
 1: single-user mode; to be used in the event of major 
    problems or system recovery;</PRE>
<PRE>
 2: multi-user mode, without networking;</PRE>
<PRE>
 3: Multi-user mode, but this time with networking;</PRE>
<PRE>
 4: unused;</PRE>
<PRE>
 5: like 3, but also launches the graphical login interface;</PRE>
<PRE>
 6: restart.</PRE>
<P>If your machine comes up and immediately goes into
an X-Window interface, then its default runlevel is 5.</P>
<P>When you say 'reboot' or 'shutdown -r now', what you
are really doing is putting the system into runlevel 6.</P>
<P>When things have gone completely to shreds (typically after
hardware failure or severe operator error ;), you want to
get the machine into runlevel 1 - there are minimal 
services running and only one person can be logged in 
at a time.</P>
<P>Now, on to the nitty-gritty.</P>
<P>The init.d subdirectory is where all the startup/shutdown
scripts are kept.  They are all text files, and you can
get a good idea of their format by cracking one open
(I'd recommend a short one) and looking at it.  You don't
need to be an expert in shell programming to get the gist
of it.</P>
<P>These scripts are called with one arguement (more on how
that arguement gets supplied later).  Virtually all scripts
have the start and stop arguement, most have a restart, and
then some have all sorts of custom ones.  Lets look at a 
quick example.</P>
<P>This is an init script for starting up Apache.
Most are more cluttered, but not really more complicated.</P>

 -----------------</PRE>
<P>Anything after a # is a comment, except for the first line.
If that is #!, then the shell starts up the command
interpreter specified (in this case another /bin/sh) and
sends all the following commands through that.  
(Don't know how far into Linux you are yet, but suffice 
it to say that shell scripts are like batch files on
steroids).</P>
<P>Moving down, we get to the first line of code.  This is just
like a case statement in C, except for the syntax 
(case block ends with a esac, which, of course, is case backwards).
$x are the positional parameters of the program
($0 is the name of the program, $1 is the first arguement, etc.)</P>
<P>The rest of the script is pretty self-explanatory.
This particular one is easy as all the complicated parts
are handled by apachectl.</P>
<P>So that's all well and good, but how and when does it
get called?  OK, lets go back to the rc0.d -&gt; rc6.d directories.
Looking in there, you can see a bunch of files that start
with K or S and a number.  If you're using a color ls, 
then you'll notice that they are a different color and there
might even be a @ after the name.  That's because these are
all symlinks to the real files in the init.d directory.</P>
<P>When the system enters a runlevel, it goes into the
appropriate /etc/rc.d/rc?.d directory and begins 
executing the files in there.  If the file begins 
with a K, then the symlink gets called with a stop
(kill) arguement; if it starts with an S the symlink
is called with a start arguement.</P>
<P>So if rc5.d has these links in it</P>

<P>the system is going to kill off postgress, nfs, rstatd, etc first
(in that order).  Then its going to start apmd, network, portmap, etc.
(in that order).</P>
<P>OK, so now you have a rough background in how the system starts.
So how do you get mh working in it?</P>
<P>The easiest way is to go into init.d, copy an existing file,
and edit that. (Remember, you're root.  Type carefully)</P>
<PRE>
 cp httpd mh
 vi mh</PRE>
<P>and change the lines so that they look something
like this</P>

 -----------------
 #!/bin/sh

 # Start mh

 esac
 -----------------</PRE>
<P>This is very, very sloppy, but you get the idea.</P>
<P>Before you go further, TEST IT!  Just call it by
hand from the command line like</P>
<PRE>
 /etc/rc.d/init.d/mh start</PRE>
<PRE>
 /etc/rc.d/init.d/mh stop</PRE>
<P>etc.</P>
<P>(you'll need to include the full path as init.d is
not in your PATH and neither is the currect directory for root)</P>
<P>Once you've gotten all the bugs worked out and its working
the way you like it, figure out which runlevels you want
this to be running in.  I'd guess 3 and 5, but its up 
to you.</P>
<P>Change into rc3.d.  Figure out when you want mh to start
compared to all the other programs.  I'd guess you'd want
to let everything else go first, then light up mh.  
So we'll give it a number of 99, effectively going last.
Make the symlink like this</P>
<PRE>
 ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/mh S99mh</PRE>
<P>Do the same thing in rc5.d</P>
<P>Now, you'll also want to have a good clean shutdown.
So you'll have to take care of runlevels 0 and 6.
Here, you'll want mh to get killed off early in 
the process, so give it a low number, say 01.</P>
<PRE>
 ln -s /etc/rc.d/init.d/mh K01mh</PRE>
<P>You'll also want to do the same in rc1.d</P>
<P>Another option is to use a package called daemontools, available at</P>

<PRE>
 <A HREF="http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html">http://cr.yp.to/daemontools/faq/create.html</A></PRE>
<P>Its essentially inetd with the features it should have.</P>
<P>When the system comes up, the daemontools program
svscan starts and then starts up any programs
you've asked it to.  Those programs are then
monitored and get restarted if they die.  The
good part here is that you can control any
program from the command line without editing
files</P>
<PRE>
 svc -h /service/yourdaemon: sends HUP
 svc -t /service/yourdaemon: sends TERM, and
        automatically restarts the daemon after it dies
 svc -d /service/yourdaemon: sends TERM, and leaves the service down
 svc -u /service/yourdaemon: brings the service back up
 svc -o /service/yourdaemon: runs the service once</PRE>
<P>-------------------------</P>
<P>The following is from Harald Koch on 04/2002</P>
<P>I'll offer an alternate method. Neither is really better or worse; it
depends on your environment and requirements.</P>
<P>I have a strong preference for running mission critical software
directly from init, instead of from startup scripts; init will
automatically restart software that crashes. I do this with misterhouse,
SSH, and a database that I run.</P>
<P>init is controlled from a file called (usually) /etc/inittab. Here's my
MH entry from inittab:</P>
<PRE>
 mh:2345:respawn:/home/mhouse/mhinit</PRE>
<P>This tells init to run ``/home/mhouse/mhinit'' when the computer is in any
multi-user mode (see Mike's message for a definition of runlevels), and
to run it again when it exits.</P>
<P>And here's my script:</P>
<PRE>
 ----- /home/mhouse/mhinit -----
 #!/bin/sh</PRE>
<PRE>
 mhhome=/home/mhouse</PRE>
<PRE>
 cd ${mhhome}</PRE>
<PRE>
 exec &gt;&gt; error_log 2&gt;&amp;1</PRE>
<PRE>
 export PATH=${mhhome}/mh/bin:${mhhome}/bin:$PATH
 export mh_parms=${mhhome}/mh.ini</PRE>
<PRE>
 # rotate logs
 /bin/mv log.3 log.4
 /bin/mv log.2 log.3
 /bin/mv log.1 log.2
 /bin/mv log.0 log.1
 /bin/mv log   log.0</PRE>
<PRE>
 # start
 exec ${mhhome}/mh/bin/mh -log_file ${mhhome}/log</PRE>
<PRE>
 ----- /home/mhouse/mhinit -----</PRE>
<P>This method *does* make it harder to stop MH, because you have to edit
/etc/inittab, change the ``respawn'' to ``off'', and then run ``telinit q'' to
tell init to re-read the config file.</P>
<P>On the other hand, it means that MH will restart itself automatically
even if it exits due to bad code, which does happen to me occaisionally.</P>

Bet a sourceforge.net account and check it in to the CVS repository there.

You send Bruce a pointer to a web page for the new code (e.g. Brad does that with the viavoice tts code).

You Bruce and/or the mailing list a copy via email.  Either full source or a diff patch file is fine.

<P>Here is the command to check out the mh repository.  Do this someplace other than your main mh directory.
It does not include all the mh code (some of which came from CPAN and is maintained elsewhere),
so you will not be able to run out of this directory.
Also change username to your sourceforge id:</P>
<PRE>
  cd \sourceforge
  cvs -d:ext:username@cvs.misterhouse.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/misterhouse co mh</PRE>
<P>When you have code you want to check in, you would do it with somethink like this:</P>
<PRE>
  cp \mh\lib\http_server.pl \sourceforge\mh\lib
  cd \sourceforge\mh\lib
  cvs commit http_server.pl</PRE>
<P>You don't have to do the CVS thing if you want to make mh changes.  Most changes are simply emailed to Bruce.

instant ON/OFF control to the relay built into the wireless receiver.  All other X10 devices
have about a 1/2 second delay to send and receive the protocol over the power lines.</P>
<P>The CM11 is a 2 way interface, so you can program mh events to react to X10 motion sensor 
and button pushes from various X10 controlers (e.g. keychain and palmpads).
Some of the newer, more expensive modules, like the $35 LM14A lamp module,
allow you to query their status, so you can determine it status even if it were manually turned on or off.</P>
<P>If decide you splurge for the CM11 activehome kit, you might as well also get the Firecracker kit.
For the extra $6, you also get a few extra modules and mh can support both the CM11 and the CM17 
on the same port.</P>
<P>There is lots of great X10 info at <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/ido_bartana">http://www.geocities.com/ido_bartana</A> , 
including information on using and buying X10 hardward outside of the US.</P>
<P>Here is some more info, copied from a misterhouse-users post by Kevin Olalde.</P>
<P>The firecracker hardware, CM17 which plugs into the PC, can only send radio
frequency (RF) commands to devices.  With the kit you will also get a
transceiver, TM751, that receives commands from the CM17 and relays
commands for the house code it's set to via your power lines.  You also get
a lamp module, LM465,  which can be control with via the transceiver.  With
the PalmPad or the CM17 you send RF commands  to the TM751, those commands
are then relayed to the lamp module (or other power line receiver modules,
like light switches).  All of this is one way communications, the LM465
lamp module and the TM751 transceiver are not capable of reporting status.
The TM751 doubles as an appliance module hard coded to unit 1.  You can
only control it though RF commands, it does not respond to power pline
commands.</P>
<P>The next step I took was to order the Active Home kit.  With it you get
(among other stuff), another transceiver, RR501, and another computer
interface, CM11A.  The RR501 works like the TM751, in that it receives RF
commands, and relays then on to the power line.  A difference is that the
RR501 can report it's status.  The computer interface, CM11A, can send
power line commands (you use computer software to tell the interface what
commands to send), 'sees' all commands being sent over the power line (and
reports those commands to computer software), and can ask modules for their
status.  The RR501 also doubles as an appliance module, it can be set to
unit code 1 or 9, and can be controlled with both RF and power line
commands.</P>
<P>The majority of the devices, lamp modules, appliance modules, wall
switches, ..... are one way devices, they can only receive.  I have no
historical perspective, but it looks as though that was the way the
original X10 spec went, one way only.</P>
<P>There are devices that can report their current status to something like
the CM11A, but I haven't used any of then (except for the RR501), since
that are much more expense.</P>

<P>Here is a post from Clay Jackson</P>
<P>Right now, I've got 3 sensors (DS1822, in the three-lead package, inside an
epoxy filled soda straw) at the end of 150' of Radio Shack ``flat'' cable,
talking to a DS9097U (the U is CRITICAL) with no problems.  On the bench, I
had another 2 sensors on the end of a 50' cable (for a total of 5 sensors).
When I strung the 50' cable, I must have crimped a lead, because it now
meters ``closed'' and when it was plugged into the ``net'', I got no readings.</P>
<P>I also have an HA5 from Point-Six; that I'm gonna play with soon. The code
Bruce did is for the 9097U, so that's why I started there (and, it's
cheaper).  The 9097U has all the ``passive'' pull-up stuff the data sheets
talk about (courtesy of a DS2048 inside the DB9); so I'm hoping it will do
the trick.  Anyway, I'll keep the list posted as things progress.</P>
<P>Bottom line - all I needed was Bruce's code, a 9097U from Dallas, the
sensors and some Radio Shack ``phone'' cable.</P>
<P>One more thing to watch - as best I can tell, Dallas has not standardized
their thermal devices with respect to their outputs.  For example, the
DS1820 and DS1920  both return a 9 bit value that's basically an integer.
However, the DS1822 returns a VARIABLE length value (12 bits by default),
with a binary point between the 3rd and 4th digits.  According to someone
else on the list, the ThermoCRON iButton is different yet again.</P>
<P>Here is another post from Jeff Pagel (06/2002).</P>
<P>The Dallas '1-wire' bus for the ibutton family is actually 2 wires(there
are only 2 connecting points on the devices).  1 for signal and power, the
other for ground.  They talk about cat-5, which has 8 conductors, a lot
because the signal charactoristics of it are very good for the '1-wire'
bus, twisted pairs, size of the wire, etc..  Of the 8, you only need to use
2.  Theoretically, the other 6 could be used for something else.</P>
<P>So, back to the original problem, you would need to run a twisted pair,
like cat5 or cat3, from your mh machine to the garage.  I have cat5 runs of
over 500 feet that work fine without any special conditioning.</P>
<P>The cool part about the 1-wire bus is that you just need to run 1(ok
actually 2,but usually in 1 bundle) <CODE>wire(s)</CODE> around your house.  It's like a
'multi-drop' system.  One connects to the other, to the other, etc., in
parallel.</P>
<PRE>
 In this case, you would run a line, from 1 spool of wire, to the bedroom
to the living room to the kids room back to the computer.  If this is a
pre-existing structure, you will face some wiring issues.  It's much easier
for new construction.  For each ibutton, you would connect 'across' each
line.  Just solder plus to plus, minus to minus and keep the wire going.
Think of a railroad track as the 'wire' and the railroad ties as the
ibutton devices.</PRE>
<P>The 1-wire bus is fairly restrictive on how you wire it vs how long the
runs are.  You should avoid 'star' type configurations.  They are ok, but
only for short runs, the stars introduce reflections of the signal.</P>
<P>Here will be a really bad ascii representation:</P>

<P>From Yannick Moussette (06/2002)</P>
<P>The DS1820 Temp sensors come in 2 models: iButton and TO-220 
(transistor-type casing).</P>
<P>The Ibutton has a total of 2 connections, ground and signal. It functions in 
``parasitic'' mode to draw its power from the signal connections (kinda of 
like what X10 modules do to piggyback signals on powerlines...).</P>
<P>Where things that may confuse you on Dallas's Website site, is the TO-220 
format of this same sensor which has 3 leads (connections). 1 for power, 1 
for ground and 1 for signal(data). The power lead may be omitted, in which 
case the sensor will work exactly like its iButton counterpart: Through 
parasitic powering.</P>
