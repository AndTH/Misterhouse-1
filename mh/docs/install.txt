Mister House Install Instructions
System Requirements
    Mister House has been tested on Windows 95, 98, NT, 2000, and the unix
    OSes Linux, FreeBSD, and AIX. In theory, much of the function should run
    on any platform that can run Perl.

    The core Mister House code will use between 10 and 30 Megabytes of
    memory. On Windows, the VR (Voice Recognition) function takes about 10
    MB and the TTS (Text To Speech) function takes about 15 MB. On Linux,
    the Festival TTS engine takes about 20-30 MB of memory. So, with TTS
    enabled, on Windows you can get by with 32 Meg, but you will need 64 Meg
    or more to run with low speech latency. See FAQ question 1.2 for more
    info on memory usage.

    The cpu time used -vs- loops per second is controllable. On a 100 MHz
    Pentium with a 100 ms sleep time, mh uses about 20% of the cpu and gets
    about 8 passes per second.

Quick Install Instructions
    These are the quick instructions for those of you who, like me, don't
    like to read instructions:

  Windows users

     - Download the the misterhouse_src_###.zip and misterhouse_win_###.zip files
       from  http://misterhouse.net:81/download

     - cd to where you want the mh directory created in (e.g. c:\misterhouse). 
       Avoid directories with spaces in the name (e.g. \program files\)

     - unzip \downloads\misterhouse_src_###.zip (wherever you downloaded it to)

     - unzip \downloads\misterhouse_win_###.zip (wherever you downloaded it to)
 
     - cd mh\bin

     - mh.bat (this will call mh.exe or 'perl mh')

  Unix users

     - Download the the latest rpm, tar, or zip file 
       from http://misterhouse.net:81/download

     - If using the rpm file:
         rpm -i misterhouse-#.##-1.noarch.rpm
         docs are installed to /usr/doc/misterhouse-#.##, everything else is in /usr/local/mh

     - If using the tar file:
         cd to where you want it the mh directory created in (e.g. cd /projects/misterhouse)
         tar -xzvf misterhouse-#.##.tar.gz

     - If using the zip file:
         cd to where you want it the mh directory created in (e.g. cd /projects/misterhouse)
         unzip -aU /downloads/misterhouse_src_###.zip (wherever you downloaded it to) 

     - Run Configure to convert C serial headers to perl headers:
        - cd mh/bin
        - chmod +x configure
        - su   (to run configure as root)
        - ./configure
        - exit (to switch back from root)

     - ./mhl (if that doesn't work, try: mh or perl mh)

  Tips

    To use less memory and cpu, or if you get graphics related errors, you
    can run without the local gui inteface with: mh -tk 0

    The default setup runs all the test scripts in the mh\code\test
    directory. Point your web browser to http://localhost:8080 and try out a
    few commands. Also try 'telnet localhost 1234' and type one of the
    commands you saw on the web interface (e.g. 'say something good to
    Bruce').
