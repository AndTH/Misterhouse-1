<h3>Testimonials</h3>
<p>Here is where we brag about how cool we think MisterHouse is.
These are randomly selected (i.e. all) snippets fan mail.
I dropped author names so I didn't have to bother with permission to post ...
this also that allows me to make up complements when I need a morale boost :)

<p>04/2002
I just wanted to personally thank you for the excellent and awesome
work in MisterHouse. Well done!! You and all who have contributed have
done an excellent job!

<p>04/2002
I've been using MisterHouse for 4 months now and I would 
like to congratulate you for such a great project. Of 
course it takes some time to understand all capabilities, 
but it's very powerfull !!

<p>04/2002
Thanks for the great software - I've now automated everything from the pool solar heater
to the outside awnings to the washing machine; not to mention some lights :-) 

<p>03/2002
After quite some time using MH I'm must admit I'm still impressed with it.

<p>03/2002
First, I'd like to thank Bruce and all the contributors for a wonderful
open source project.  Proving once again where real innovation comes from.
I have pretty much decided that MH will be the focal point of my HA system.

<p>03/2002
Finding MisterHouse was a godsend, as I was
thinking about doing the same sort of thing
from scratch, which would have taken forever.

<p>09/2001
You are the best homeautomation developer out of all of the ones that are multiplatform
and GPL who have a surname that is also a season. :) 

<p>08/2001
Thank you so much, I found your page last night, and lost quite a bit of
sleep pouring over the pages, installing, and talking to my computer :)
My wife is on vacation, I can't wait to surprise her, I have been talking
for months how I can't wait till the day when I can go "computer, living room lights 20%"


<p>06/2001
Don't know if your into fan mail, but this is about the coolest site/system/setup I have ever seen.
The GPS intergration is really over the top.   I just got into this stuff so maybe
I'm easily impressed but your setup is really unbelievable. 

<p>05/2001
Well, I guess you already heard that from some other people but here comes again:
Misterhouse is a wonderfull software!

<p>05/2001
I have toyed around with all kinds of home automation ideas over the years and
I was astonished to find out about MisterHouse.  I am just getting started with it,
but I can tell you it has been a long time since I've have seen such a complete hacker's toolkit.  

<p>05/2001
I have been working with Misterhouse for quite some time the past couple years
and I am still amazed at the extent and flexibility of Misterhouse.  Thanks Bruce for such great software!

<p>04/2001
Thank you for all the work that you and the other contributors have put into Misterhouse.
It is a fantastic system and just keeps getting better.

<p>04/2001
Thanks alot Bruce.  That kicks ass!!!  I got my new toy (X-10) a couple years ago and it rocked for a while.
It had become an old toy till last week when I discovered MH.
Bruce, you are on my list of most loved people ever!!!
1. Me
2. Eberhard Anheuser and Adolphus Busch

4. My Girlfriend


<p>03/2001
Your mh is reaaly fantastic and your support too, I hope you could continue this effort!
I think that wap devices with mh will be very appreciated here in France and Europe.

<p>02/2001
I wanted to thank Bruce and everyone who has contributed to this really great program! 

<p>01/2001
I have been running MisterHouse for about a month now,  and really enjoy it! Loads of fun!

<p>01/2001
I love the misterhouse code.  I have used it for about a month now and have had a great time playing with lights, motion detectors, etc.
Thanks for putting all the work into MisterHouse.  It is truly fun to play with and a great way to learn Perl.

<p>12/2000 Misterhouse ROCKS!!! The question of "What do I get me for Christams ?" has been solved.  
Thanks a ton looks like fun.

<p>12/2000 I recently took a look around at other Home Automation software, 
and can happily say that MisterHouse is the best of the best, and definitely 
the cheapest!   It's been a great way to learn PERL, too.

<p>11/2000 Thank you for sharing your amazing program, ran it up on my linux box
and it smacked me in the face like halibut handled by a jealous fishwife!

<p>11/2000 Thanks again for this awesome program.  I havent
been able to stop playing with it since I downloaded it.  I think my
wife is getting jealous of the computer :)

<p>11/2000 KA, Long Island, NY USA.  
I've been using mh for about a year now and am so glad I found it
(which, by the way, happened by accident!). However, I won't address 
its coolness (that's a given!). I want to commend its author and its user community. 
If Corporate IT worked as well, you'd see productivity and innovation increase out the WAZOO! 

<p>11/2000  I would like to start by first saying
"Wow!"  Thank you Bruce for opening my eyes to the full potential of HA.  I
have MH installed on a NT server running perl 5.22.  I just got my Home
Director Starter Kit today from Smarthome (on sale for $28) with the CM11A.  I
installed the TTS, and VR modules from the Microsoft SDK.  Both TTS and VR are
working.

<p>10/2000  I have been playing around with your
MisterHouse stuff for a few weeks.  This is great stuff!  (as you probably
already know!)

<p>09/2000  I really thought my setup was almost
complete.  Running across your site turned my X10 world upside down!  I
downloaded your software on Friday, 9/22/2000.  I followed the instructions
and downloaded MisterHouse, Microsoft Voice, PERL and all accompanying
software.  The PERL scripts intimidated me at first since this was my first
foray into this scripting language.  However, following your examples, by
Sunday night, 9/24/2000, I had transferred all my macros and scenes over to
MisterHouse.  Using your provided X10 examples, in this short amount of time
I’ve scripted over 2,000 voice commands that control every
light/lamp/appliance on my X10 network. I now have full voice control (on/off,
bright/dim) over every device with around 95% accuracy (with only 1 training
session on the voice application).

<p>07/2000  Bruce, I must say I am at once
impressed with the volume and usefulness of what you've made available in MH,
and also grateful that you've taken the GPL route to publishing your work.

<p>01/2000  About then I ran across Mr. House.
Wonderful stuff!  Thank You!  Each project like this requires an original
inspiration; for MH you're it. Thanks for bringing this lovely idea into the
world and thanks for sharing it with all of us.

<p>12/1999  First, thanks for sharing your
work. You're now officially "famous" in my book! I found HAL a bit restrictive
but an open source PERL HA program, now that rocks (being a PERL lover
myself).

<p>11/1999  I just wanted to drop you a quick line
to say that your program is GREAT!  I haven't programmed since college, but I
picked back up on it very quickly.  Great job and thanks for going open
source.

<p>10/1999  Thanks for making your software available to
the HA community. It looks like you've done a tremendous amount of work. It's
great to be able to just dive in and write perl code because you've already
taken care of a lot of the dirty work.  You also chose a really cool name for
it. "Mister House" almost sounds like the title of a song my all time favorite
band (They Might Be Giants) would sing.

<p>10/1999  I downloaded your MisterHouse program
last night and I must say this is the BEST program I have ever used!!  I am a
serious gadget geek and this program has all the features I have been looking
for in a program!  You have done an excellent job with this program!!!  I am
recomending this program to all my friends, associated and family!  I have had
a wonderful time configuring it and setting it up to do what I want it to do.
This program is a dream come true for me!

<p>09/1999  Just got it running, and I am impressed. Kudos to
you, fine sir.  Already the kids are amazed, and the wife is amused, and I'm
happy.

<p>09/1999  I have been lurking on this list and
reading as much as I could find on mh.  Let me tell you - I am impressed.  It
sure seems like a powerful program and you can't beat the price.  Thank you
Bruce!

<p>05/1999  I just started looking at MisterHouse this
weekend - so far I'm very impressed.  I've got basic X10 control, voice
recognition, and speech working already and quickly implemented a numeric
pager module.  I'm using the compiled version (ver 1.54) and a CM-11.  I don't
know perl yet, but it looks like I'll be learning quickly...
