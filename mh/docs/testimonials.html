<h3>Testimonials</h3>

<p>11/00 Thank you for sharing your amazing program, ran it up on my linux box
and it smacked me in the face like halibut handled by a jealous fishwife!

<p>11/00 Thanks again for this awesome program.  I havent
been able to stop playing with it since I downloaded it.  I think my
wife is getting jealous of the computer :)

<p>11/00 KA, Long Island, NY USA.  
I've been using mh for about a year now and am so glad I found it
(which, by the way, happened by accident!). However, I won't address 
its coolness (that's a given!). I want to commend its author and its user community. 
If Corporate IT worked as well, you'd see productivity and innovation increase out the WAZOO! 

<p>11/00  I would like to start by first saying
"Wow!"  Thank you Bruce for opening my eyes to the full potential of HA.  I
have MH installed on a NT server running perl 5.22.  I just got my Home
Director Starter Kit today from Smarthome (on sale for $28) with the CM11A.  I
installed the TTS, and VR modules from the Microsoft SDK.  Both TTS and VR are
working.

<p>10/00  I have been playing around with your
MisterHouse stuff for a few weeks.  This is great stuff!  (as you probably
already know!)

<p>09/00  I really thought my setup was almost
complete.  Running across your site turned my X10 world upside down!  I
downloaded your software on Friday, 9/22/2000.  I followed the instructions
and downloaded MisterHouse, Microsoft Voice, PERL and all accompanying
software.  The PERL scripts intimidated me at first since this was my first
foray into this scripting language.  However, following your examples, by
Sunday night, 9/24/2000, I had transferred all my macros and scenes over to
MisterHouse.  Using your provided X10 examples, in this short amount of time
I’ve scripted over 2,000 voice commands that control every
light/lamp/appliance on my X10 network. I now have full voice control (on/off,
bright/dim) over every device with around 95% accuracy (with only 1 training
session on the voice application).

<p>07/00  Bruce, I must say I am at once
impressed with the volume and usefulness of what you've made available in MH,
and also grateful that you've taken the GPL route to publishing your work.

<p>01/00  About then I ran across Mr. House.
Wonderful stuff!  Thank You!  Each project like this requires an original
inspiration; for MH you're it. Thanks for bringing this lovely idea into the
world and thanks for sharing it with all of us.

<p>12/99  First, thanks for sharing your
work. You're now officially "famous" in my book! I found HAL a bit restrictive
but an open source PERL HA program, now that rocks (being a PERL lover
myself).

<p>11/99  I just wanted to drop you a quick line
to say that your program is GREAT!  I haven't programmed since college, but I
picked back up on it very quickly.  Great job and thanks for going open
source.

<p>10/99  Thanks for making your software available to
the HA community. It looks like you've done a tremendous amount of work. It's
great to be able to just dive in and write perl code because you've already
taken care of a lot of the dirty work.  You also chose a really cool name for
it. "Mister House" almost sounds like the title of a song my all time favorite
band (They Might Be Giants) would sing.

<p>10/99  I downloaded your MisterHouse program
last night and I must say this is the BEST program I have ever used!!  I am a
serious gadget geek and this program has all the features I have been looking
for in a program!  You have done an excellent job with this program!!!  I am
recomending this program to all my friends, associated and family!  I have had
a wonderful time configuring it and setting it up to do what I want it to do.
This program is a dream come true for me!

<p>09/99  Just got it running, and I am impressed. Kudos to
you, fine sir.  Already the kids are amazed, and the wife is amused, and I'm
happy.

<p>09/99  I have been lurking on this list and
reading as much as I could find on mh.  Let me tell you - I am impressed.  It
sure seems like a powerful program and you can't beat the price.  Thank you
Bruce!

<p>05/99  I just started looking at MisterHouse this
weekend - so far I'm very impressed.  I've got basic X10 control, voice
recognition, and speech working already and quickly implemented a numeric
pager module.  I'm using the compiled version (ver 1.54) and a CM-11.  I don't
know perl yet, but it looks like I'll be learning quickly...
